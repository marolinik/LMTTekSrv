## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use?

**Check what's using the port:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Linux/Mac
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :3001
```

**Solution:** Stop the process or change ports in `docker-compose.yml`

### Can't Access the Application?

1. Check if containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. All three services should show "Up":
   - lmtek-postgres
   - lmtek-backend
   - lmtek-frontend

3. If any service is not up, check logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs [service-name]
   ```

### Database Issues?

Reset everything:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Frontend Not Loading?

Wait a bit longer (first build can take 2-3 minutes) or rebuild:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build frontend
```
